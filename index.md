# About me

I am an astrophysicist currently working as an [Academy Research Fellow](https://research.fi/en/results/funding/83042) at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) (Finland), leading a project that connects **plasma astrophysics** and **X-ray observations** to constrain the physics of **neutron stars**.

My work is carried out in collaboration with the **Plasma Astrophysics Group**, led by **Joonas Nättilä**, and with the group of **Anna Watts** at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/) (The Netherlands), where I previously spent about three years as a postdoctoral researcher.

My research focuses on **neutron stars**—including their cores, atmospheres, and magnetospheres—using techniques such as **X-ray pulse profile modeling** and **particle-in-cell simulations**. I make extensive use of X-ray observations from instruments like **NICER** and **IXPE**.

I completed my PhD in 2020 at the [University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en/university) (Finland), in the **High-Energy Astrophysics Group** led by **Juri Poutanen**.


### Research

My research focuses on topics in **high-energy and plasma astrophysics**, including **neutron stars**, **magnetospheric return currents**, **X-ray pulse profile modeling**, the **equation of state of dense matter**, **neutron star atmospheres**, **radiative transfer**, **X-ray polarimetry**, and **accretion phenomena**.

In my work, I use **particle-in-cell simulations**, **high-performance computing**, and **statistical inference**, and I develop computational tools in **Python**, **Julia**, **Fortran**, and **C++**.
