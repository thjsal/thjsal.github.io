# About me



I am an astrophysicist working currently as a Postdoctoral researcher at [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) (Finland) in the plasma astrophysics group of Joonas Nättilä.
I also work in collaboration with the group of Anna Watts at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/) (The Netherlands), where I spent about three years in my previous position.
I study neutron stars, including their core, atmosphere, and magnetosphere, using techniques such as X-ray pulse profile modeling and particle-in-cell simulations.
I make use of the X-rays observed with instruments like NICER and IXPE.
Previously, I finished my PhD (at the end of 2020) at [University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en/university) (Finland) in the high-energy astrophysics group of Juri Poutanen.


### Research

I mainly study topics related to high-energy and plasma astrophysics, including neutron stars, magnetospheric return currents, X-ray pulse profile modeling, equation of state of dense matter, neutron star atmospheres, radiative transfer, X-ray polarimetry, and accretion phenomena. In my work, I apply particle-in-cell simulations, high-performance computing, coding in Python/Julia/Fortran/C++ language, and statistical inference.
