# About me



I am an astrophysicist working currently as a Postdoctoral researcher in [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/) (The Netherlands) in collaboration with the group of Anna Watts. 
I study neutron stars using X-ray instruments like NICER and IXPE.
Previously, I finished my PhD (at the end of 2020) in [University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en/university) (Finland) in the high-energy astrophysics group of Juri Poutanen.


### Research

I mainly study topics related to high-energy astrophysics, including neutron stars, X-ray pulse profile modeling, equation of state of dense matter, neutron star atmospheres, radiative transfer, X-ray polarimetry, and accretion phenomena. In my work, I apply methods such as high-performance computing, coding in Python/Julia/Fortran/C++ language, and statistical inference. A CV and a publication list will be added here.
